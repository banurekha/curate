# Reporting Issues

Submit a [well written issue](#what-is-a-well-written-issue) to [Github's issue tracker](./issues).
This will require a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) *(its free)*.

## What is a well written issue?

* Provide a descriptive summary
* Reference the Curate gem version in which you encountered the problem
* Explain the expected behavior
* Explain the actual behavior
* Provide steps to reproduce the actual behavior

# Git Flow Branching Strategy

Curate uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as its branching procedure.
We acknowledge that this adds additional complexities to the branching process.
It is our belief that the project's code health is better for these complexities.

## Why Git Flow?

The **master** branch should **always be deployable**…
And therefore anyone cloning the Curate repository will have a vetted version of Curate to work against.

**Urgent fixes** should be quick to apply…
And therefore anyone that has adopted Curate can quickly apply those fixes.

**Completed features** should be released as one unit…
And therefore an adopter does not see portions of an incomplete feature in their latest point release.

The git-flow process **is a well defined procedure**…
And therefore anyone contributing to the project can reference excellent 3rd party resources on the procedure.

The git-flow process **is encoded in a [Git extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)**…
And therefore anyone contributing to the project can use the plugin to adhear to the branching procedure.

And best of all, **we don't have to write our own procedure** that would require additional vetting.

## Possible Gotchas

With Git Flow, releases are minted on the master branch.
It is likely that releases may need to be minted relative to a past release (i.e. need to back port an urgent fix).
At that point we will need to create a version stable branch to apply urgent fix.

# Making Changes

Curate is an open source project, released under the [APACHE 2 license](LICENSE).
You are free to clone or [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and modify the code as you see fit.

## Coding Guidelines

Will be brought in from [README](./README.md)

## Where to Engage for Help

Curate is part of ProjectHydra, so you can [connect via the usual ProjectHydra channels](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Connect).

# Submitting Changes

## Contributor License Agreement

**Note: You can submit a pull request before you've signed the Contributor License Agreement, but we won't merge your changes until we have your CLA on file.**

Before Curate, or any [ProjectHydra project](https://github.com/projecthydra) can accept your contributions into the [canonical Curate repository](https://github.com/projecthydra/curate), we must have a [Contributor License Agreement on file](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Project+Intellectual+Property+Licensing+and+Ownership).

All code contributors must have an Individual Contributor License Agreement (iCLA) on file with the Hydra Project Steering Group.
If the contributor works for an institution, the institution must have a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (cCLA) on file.

[More on the Contributor License Agreements](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Project+Intellectual+Property+Licensing+and+Ownership)

## Well Written Code

Will be brought in from [README](./README).

It includes:

* Adhering to coding standards
* Writing of unit tests to verify you've done it right

## Well Written Commit Messages

**TL;DR** - First line is < 50 characters; The message body explains what the code changes are about; Reference any JIRA or Github issues.

```
    Present tense short summary (50 characters or less)

    More detailed description, if necessary. It should be wrapped to 72
    characters. Try to be as descriptive as you can, even if you think that
    the commit content is obvious, it may not be obvious to others. You
    should add such description also if it's already present in bug tracker,
    it should not be necessary to visit a webpage to check the history.

    Description can have multiple paragraphs and you can use code examples
    inside, just indent it with 4 spaces:

        class PostsController
          def index
            respond_with Post.limit(10)
          end
        end

    You can also add bullet points:

    - you can use dashes or asterisks

    - also, try to indent next line of a point for readability, if it's too
      long to fit in 72 characters
```

> Please squash your commits into a single commit when appropriate.
> This simplifies future cherry picks, and also keeps the git log clean.

### Hooks into JIRA

Our [JIRA Scrum Story Tracker at Duraspace](https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=16) has been setup to interact with GitHub.

First, make sure that [your JIRA Profile's](https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa) email address is the same as is in your Git config email address – run `git config user.email`

Then when writing your commit message, add the identifiers of any related tasks (i.e. HYDRASIR-12) in the body of the commit message.

You can also transition a JIRA task via your commit message.
Assume the following was part of the commit message:

```bash
HYDRASIR-12 #close "Append the quoted text as a comment on the task"
```

This would:

* Transition, if valid, the HYDRASIR-12 task to the Closed state.
* Add "Append the quoted text as a comment on the task" as a comment on HYDRASIR-12

#### Valid Transition Commands

* start-work
* start-review
* stop-work
* close
* reopen

### Hooks into other Subsystems

**[log skip]**: If your commit is not relevant to a change log, you can add `[log skip]` to your commit message.
Relevance is subjective, though extremely minor changes need not be part of the change log (i.e. spelling correction, decomposing a private method into multiple private methods, etc.)

**[ci skip]**: If your commit does not need to go through the Continuous Integration server, add `[ci skip]` to your commit message.
This is typically used for updates to the documentation and stylesheet changes.

# Reviewing Changes

The review process is a conversation between the submitter and the team as a whole.
Please feel free to bring other people into the conversation as necessary.

As either the submitter or reviewer, feel free to assign the Pull Request to a Curate contributor.
This is a way of indicating that you want that Curate contributor to review the change.

When you do assign someone to the Pull Request, please make sure to add a comment stating why you assigned it to them.

## Responsibilities of a Reviewer

As a reviewer, it is important that the pull request:

* Has a (well written commit message)[#well-written-commit-messages]
* Has (well written code)[#well-written-code]
* The test suite successfully builds
* Any questions regarding the pull request are answered
* Adjucate if the Pull Request should be squashed into a smaller number of commits

## Responsibilities of the Submitter

**As the submitter**, you should be responsive to the review process: answering questions, making refinements, providing clarification, and rebasing your commits.
*If your changes are gridlocked please notify [@jeremyf](https://github.com/jeremyf) via a comment on the pull request.*

# Merging Changes

*If a pull request has received at least one Thumbs Up, but has still not been merged, please notify [@jeremyf](https://github.com/jeremyf) via a comment on the pull request.*

**As the submitter,** you should not merge your own pull request. That is bad form.

**As the reviewer,** if you are comfortable merge the pull request. Otherwise feel free to assign the pull request to another contributor for final merging.

**As the merger,** once you have merged the pull request, go ahead and delete the pull request's topic branch. You are now on the hook for any breaking of the build.
